# Question5
I’ve coded in Python and C++ and would say that there are similarities and differences. I see coding as doing the same steps but editions here and there. A python example;
print('Please enter your weight in kg(s)')
w = int(input())
print("Now enter your height in m(s)")
h = float(input())
BMI = w/(h**2)
if BMI < 18.5:
    print(" You are underweight")
elif BMI >= 18.5 and BMI < 25:
    print("You are normal")
elif BMI >= 25 and BMI < 30:
    print("You are overweight")
elif BMI > 30:
    print("You are obese")
The above code calculates one’s BMI. However, there are other ways or python codes that can be used to do such. Hence my reason for saying coding is not hard but requires a lot of practice and dedication in order to be do it with ease.
